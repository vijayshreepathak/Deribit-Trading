## Overview

The **Deribit Trading System** is built to:

- **Securely authenticate** with the Deribit API using OAuth 2.0.
- **Manage orders** including placing, modifying, and canceling orders.
- **Retrieve market data** such as the orderbook for specific instruments.
- **Manage dependencies** and build the project using **CMake**.

**Key Points:**
- **C++-only Implementation:** Every component of the system is implemented in C++.
- **CMake-Driven Build & Dependency Management:** CMake is used not only for building the project but also for managing dependencies (e.g., libcurl and JsonCpp) via integration with `vcpkg` and custom scripts.

---

## Features

### Core Functionalities
- **Authentication**
  - Uses OAuth 2.0 to securely connect to the Deribit Test API.
- **Order Management**
  - Place buy and sell orders.
  - Modify and cancel orders.
- **Market Data Retrieval**
  - Fetch real-time orderbook data for specified instruments.

### Technical Highlights
- **Dependency Management and Build System**
  - **CMake is used for building the project and managing dependencies.** All external libraries such as `libcurl` and `JsonCpp` are integrated via `vcpkg`.
  - A custom PowerShell script (`download_deps.ps1`) is available for manual dependency management.
- **Cross-Platform Support**
  - The project is configured using CMake for cross-platform builds.
  - Supports custom triplets, including Address Sanitizer (`x64-windows-asan`), for enhanced debugging.

## Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler:** A modern C++17-compliant compiler (e.g., MinGW-w64 or MSVC).
- **CMake:** Version 3.10 or higher.
- **vcpkg:** For dependency management (see the [vcpkg GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) for installation instructions).
- **PowerShell:** Required for running the `download_deps.ps1` script.
- **Deribit Test Account:** Register at [Deribit Test](https://test.deribit.com) to generate API credentials.

---

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository and change into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Deribit-Trading-System.git
cd Deribit-Trading-System-main
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies via vcpkg

Navigate to the `vcpkg` directory, bootstrap vcpkg, and install the required libraries:

```bash
cd vcpkg
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
.\vcpkg install curl:x64-windows jsoncpp:x64-windows
```

### Step 3: Configure the Project Using CMake

Create a build directory from the project root and configure the project. **CMake is used for both building the project and managing dependencies.**

```bash
cd path\to\Deribit-Trading-System-main
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"
```

### Step 4: Build the Project

Compile the project by executing:

```bash
mingw32-make
```

### Step 5: Run the Executable

Ensure that runtime DLLs (`libcurl.dll`, `jsoncpp.dll`) are present in the executable directory, then run:

```bash
.\deribit_trading_system.exe
```

## Explanation of Key Files

- **`CMakeLists.txt`**
  - The main configuration file for building the project using CMake. It handles dependency management (e.g., linking `libcurl` and `JsonCpp`).
- **`download_deps.ps1`**
  - A PowerShell script to manually download and extract dependencies if needed.
- **Source Files (`src/`)**
  - **`auth.cpp`**: Implements authentication with the Deribit API.
  - **`order.cpp`**: Implements buy order placement.
  - **`sell_order.cpp`**: Implements sell order functionality.
  - **`modify_order.cpp`**: Handles order modifications.
  - **`cancel_order.cpp`**: Implements order cancellation.
  - **`get_orderbook.cpp`**: Fetches and processes real-time market data.
- **Header Files (`include/`)**
  - Provide declarations for corresponding source files.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Dependencies
Ensure all dependencies are installed via vcpkg:

```bash
cd vcpkg
.\vcpkg install curl:x64-windows jsoncpp:x64-windows
```

### DLL Issues at Runtime
If you encounter missing DLL errors, copy the required DLLs from:

```
vcpkg/installed/x64-windows/bin/
```

to the same directory as your executable.

### CMake Build Errors
Confirm that paths in `CMakeLists.txt` correctly reflect your project’s directory structure.

## Future Enhancements

- **WebSocket Integration:** Enable real-time market data streaming.
- **Performance Optimization:** Improve memory management and implement lock-free data structures.
- **Advanced Order Types:** Add support for stop-loss, take-profit, and trailing stop orders.
- **Risk Management:** Integrate features like position sizing and maximum drawdown controls.
- **Backtesting Framework:** Incorporate historical data for strategy testing and validation.
